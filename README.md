To run the application, run npm start or expo start then choose to open the application on either ios and android.

If the insertion for the highscore receives an error, restart the server and application to fix the error.

To run the test,
run npm test for the test.js file 
run npm test button.test.js for the button.test.js file

Note that for the button.test.js we use a placeholder letter of x for the test case and we need to keep running the test till the letter buttons appear with a x letter as the 10 letter buttons for each round are randomly generated and we do not know what is the 10 random letters.
